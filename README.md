<h1>Eyes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project I used css to create a set of eyes using animated shapes, and a bit of javascript to animate the eye to track the movement of the mouse on the screen.

<h2>Instructions on how to run</h2>

All you have to do to run this app is git clone this repo and open up the index.html file on your favorite browser. Alternatively you could run this appliaction live on my website : https://bustamad12320.github.io/Eyes/ .

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

Some of the potential tweaks and updates for this project are listed below:

1. Make eyes blink with a timer every ~10 seconds

2. Make the eyes blink on click

3. Make eyes get red over time if they haven't blinked
